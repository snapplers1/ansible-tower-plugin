<div>
    Pull the output from the Tower job into Jenkins.<br/>
    If you are running a workflow, this option will show the steps the workflow is taking and their results (successful, failed, etc).
    Options are:<ul>
        <li>(false) "Do not import". No logs will be pulled in. (old checkbox disabled)</li>
        <li>(true) Import Truncated Logs. Import logs like they are displayed in Tower. Long lines will have ... at the end (old checkbox enabled)</li>
        <li>(full) Import Full Logs. Import the full string of the logs, no ... at the end.</li>
        <li>(vars) Process Variables Only. This will import the logs and parse them for variables but will not display the Tower logs in the Jenkins build log.</li>
    </ul>
    If you are planning on pulling in variables and may have large values in them you may want to consider using full or vars.
